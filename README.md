## Zybo-Z7-Diaries
Repo where I will store my Zybo Z7 files and document my journey with learning about FPGAs


# To start, I wanted to get into FPGAs, but first I need a board.

Looking at the 2 leaders in the space, I have a choice between Xilinx and Altera supported boards. With that I chose Xilinx since that is what I am learning in school and am more comfortable with.

Now I have my 2 requirements:
1. beginner-friendly board
2. supported by Xilinx

In the end I chose the Zybo Z7 since it has PMODS (which allow for easier interfacing with premade connections, helpful for a beginnner who just wants less things to worry about)

# Now its time to get the software.

Looking at Digilent's documentation, PMODs are only supported till Vivado 2019.1. However, the labs at school use 2021.1, which Im assuming a student verified that it works with PMODS. Therefore, I installed Vivado 2021.1 but I will update my findings here.

# Now its time to create projects!
